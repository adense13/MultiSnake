# Project Name

## Description

MultiSnake is a multiplayer game based on the popular game Snake. Two or more players will control their own snake with the goal of reaching and eat apples in order to grow. All while avoiding colliding with the edges of the game level.. and other players!

## Controls

Each arrow key on your keyboard will turn your snake in its corresponding direction. The snake CANNOT be turned backwards or forward - ONLY left and right. The reference frame is the direction in which the snake's head is currently moving.
