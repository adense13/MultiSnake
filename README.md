# MultiSnake

--Description--

MultiSnake is a multiplayer game based on the popular game Snake. Two or more players will control their own snake with the goal of reaching and eat apples in order to grow. All while avoiding colliding with the edges of the game level.. and other players!



--Features--

*Each player control his/her own snake.

*Snakes always move forward, but players can turn it either right or left - changing its direction.

*Colliding with walls or other plays result in immediate destruction of the snake.

*Eating an apple - in essence colliding your snake's head with the apple - results in the player gaining points and the snake grows.

*Each player's snake will have its own color (not decided)



--Implementation--

The game will be implemented using Java's Swing library.



--Controls--
*Each arrow key on your keyboard will turn your snake in its corresponding direction. The snake CANNOT be turned backwards or forward - ONLY left and right. The reference frame is the direction in which the snake's head is currently moving.
